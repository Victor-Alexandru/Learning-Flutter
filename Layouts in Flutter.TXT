 ->Container is a widget class that allows you to customize its child widget.
       Use a Container when you want to add padding, margins, borders, or background color, to name some of its capabilities.

->All layout widgets have either of the following:
       A child property if they take a single child – for example, Center or Container

        To create a row or column in Flutter, you add a list of children widgets to a Row or Column widget. In turn, each child can itself be a row or column, and so on.
        The following example shows how it is possible to nest rows or columns inside of rows or columns.
