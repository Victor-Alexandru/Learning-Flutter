 ->Container is a widget class that allows you to customize its child widget.
       Use a Container when you want to add padding, margins, borders, or background color, to name some of its capabilities.

->All layout widgets have either of the following:
       A child property if they take a single child – for example, Center or Container
       A children property if they take a list of widgets – for example, Row, Column, ListView, or Stack.
       Add the Text widget to the Center widget:
->Basic stuff:
        To create a row or column in Flutter, you add a list of children widgets to a Row or Column widget. In turn, each child can itself be a row or column, and so on.
        The following example shows how it is possible to nest rows or columns inside of rows or columns.
->Stuff for even space on rows / columns :
       The render box (in this case, the entire screen) is more than 300 pixels wide, so setting the main axis alignment
        to spaceEvenly divides the free horizontal space evenly between, before, and after each image.
->Important :
       Widgets can be sized to fit within a row or column by using the Expanded widget. 
       To fix the previous example where the row of images is too wide for its render box, wrap each image with an Expanded widget.
       ex:Expanded(
              child: Image.asset('images/pic1.jpg'),
              ),
->Packing : 
       By default, a row or column occupies as much space along its main axis as possible, 
       but if you want to pack the children closely together, set its mainAxisSize to MainAxisSize.min. \
       The following example uses this property to pack the star icons together.

       Widget _buildList() => ListView(
       children: [
              _tile('CineArts at the Empire', '85 W Portal Ave', Icons.theaters),

              _tile('La Ciccia', '291 30th St', Icons.restaurant),
       ],
       );

       ListTile _tile(String title, String subtitle, IconData icon) => ListTile(
       title: Text(title,
              style: TextStyle(
              fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
              fontSize: 20,
              )),
       subtitle: Text(subtitle),
       leading: Icon(
